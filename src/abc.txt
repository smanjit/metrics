let us forget . what matters it that we <eos> once reigned o'er happy realms of long ago <eos> and talked of love , and let our voices low <eos> and ruled for some brief sessions royally <eos> what if we sung , or laughed , or wept maybe <eos> it has availed not anything , and so <eos> let it go by that we may better know <eos> how poor a thing is lost to you and me <eos> but yesterday i kissed your lips , and yet <eos> did thrill you not enough to shake the dew <eos> from your drenched lids â€” and missed , with no regret <eos> your kiss shot back , with sharp breaths failing you <eos> and so , to day , while our worn eyes are wet <eos> with all this waste of tears , let us forget
